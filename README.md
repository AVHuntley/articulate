# Articulate
Articulate is a custom written voice control program designed for ArmA. It makes controlling your squad simply a matter of saying what you wish them to do.

For example, instead of having to remember that the **Open Fire** command for your whole squad is `~ 3 1` you can simply say "All, open fire".

For more information on the commands currently available, take a look at the wiki's [commands](https://github.com/Mpstark/articulate/wiki/Commands) page.
